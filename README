  What is it?
  -----------

    Nook® Resigner is a script designed for Linux (Tested with
    Ubuntu 14.04) which automates the steps to resign your Nook®
    files previously signed with B&N keys in order to allow
    system apps modifications and easy resigning.
    The script can also optionally patch ReaderRMSDK in order 
    to use external apk file and convert original dictionaries.
